## The Problem: The Codebase Comprehension Bottleneck

In modern software development, developers spend up to 70% of their time navigating vast, complex, and often poorly documented codebases. This "comprehension tax" slows down innovation, makes onboarding new engineers difficult, and forces senior developers to spend more time explaining old code than writing new code. Existing tools can search for keywords, but they cannot provide a true, holistic understanding of a project's architecture and logic.

## Our Solution: An Autonomous Analyst

CEREBRO is designed to eliminate this bottleneck. It ingests an entire public GitHub repository and becomes a trusted, interactive expert on that specific project.

It features a unique, dual-workflow architecture powered by a team of specialized IBM Granite models:

1.  **Intent-Aware Analysis:** CEREBRO first classifies a user's natural language request as either an `ANALYSIS` or `CREATION` task.
2.  **Grounded Analysis Workflow:** For analysis, it uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide detailed explanations and code examples that are **provably grounded in the repository's source code**, complete with source citations.
3.  **Self-Healing Creation Workflow:** For creation, CEREBRO autonomously writes new code, generates unit tests for it, executes those tests, andâ€”if they failâ€”analyzes the error to debug and rewrite its own code until validation is passed.

This moves beyond a simple chatbot to an active, autonomous development partner that can reason, create, and self-correct.
